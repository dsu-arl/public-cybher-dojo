Welcome! We recommend you start with a few challenges in "Using the Dojo" and "Linus Basics" to give you the base knowledge required for the other modules. Then pick whatever topic sounds fun and dive in!

The "Using the Dojo" module was imported from the pwn.college homepage, all other challenges were created by Dakota State University. Good luck!
